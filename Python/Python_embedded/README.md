# Hardware Code Snippets

- Here are some code snippets that will help you configure hardware using Python 3. The repository includes interfaces for various components such as WiFi, Bluetooth, Bluetooth keyboards, SIM modems, GPS modems, and more.

## Bluetooth Keypad Configuration
- The Bluetooth keypad code is used to configure a TFT display connected via SPI. This setup is necessary because the direct output from the Bluetooth keyboard wonâ€™t be displayed on the screen without proper integration.

## Additional Peripheral Configurations
- I've configured additional peripherals like touch screens, cameras, iris scanners, and fingerprint readers, but I didn't include their code here since support for these is widely available on the internet.

- Feel free to explore the code snippets and use them to enhance your hardware projects!
