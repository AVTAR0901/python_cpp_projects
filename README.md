# python_cpp_projects

Welcome to my project repository!

This repository contains a collection of mostly Python and C++ projects that I have worked on while learning new technologies or tackling interesting challenges. You'll also find solutions to various issues I encountered during my journey in software and embedded development.

I aim to keep this repository updated as I explore new topics and solve more problems. Feel free to explore the projects, use them as a reference, or even adapt them for your own work. If you have any questions or need clarification, don’t hesitate to reach out—I enjoy solving problems and learning from discussions.

Happy coding!
